There are one python programs here (-h for usage) and one txt file:

- `seq2seq.py` translates input sentences from French to English using local attention with a default batch size of 6.
- `translations` is the best translations obtained by running seq2seq

The command work will run the program. For example:

    > python seq2seq.py
    
The translations.txt is obtained by running following code: 
    > python seq2seq.py
